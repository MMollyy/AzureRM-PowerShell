# AzureRM-PowerShell

This repository is intended for powershell scripts written for Azure RM.
Each script will be added as a seperate file in the repository. I will try and keep the names as functional and logical as I can.

I use a lot of sources like https://docs.microsoft.com, but also searches via google.

I intend to write all scripts in such a style that they can be used manually. Parameterized where possible. To allow the script to be editted for automation. All scripts require some description with the parts to make the part understandable. Why? For people new to powershell. As I found this to be one of the most blocking factors when finding scripts or parts of them on the internet.

Do note that I am not an expert at Powershell, and my scripting might look inefficient. However, any improvement with documentation inside the script is welcome.
